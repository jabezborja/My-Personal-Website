                    Hi, I am <strong>Jabez Emmanuel Borja</strong>, a Junior High School student, 16 years old and I live in Laguna, Philippines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have a great team and we are currently working on <a href="https://facebook.com/KoowentuTeam">Koowentu</a>, a Filipino social storytelling, content-sharing, and community platform.
                    I also work as a Mobile Application Developer at Unirises, I am the one of the developers of the Unihub product.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>My Programming History:</strong>
                    <br>
                    I started programming when I was 13 years old, creating games on Roblox, an online video game platform using Lua C Programming Language. I decided to make Roblox games because me and my friends love playing Roblox that time. Me and my friend Vincent back then decided to make game on Roblox. I am the programming side of the game and he is the 3D Modelling side. We had fun making games and invite our friends to join the game we created. It is called "Fruit Obby", we created a Parkour-like game and our friends enjoyed it a lot and they always suggest a feature and report bugs on us. That was the time I found out that I am quite good at solving problems/programming. Until my friend Vincent moved to different city and we are not working on it anymore and I stopped programming. 2 years ago, I started to make websites and learn HTML and CSS. I was just renting a computer on a computer shop then and having a hard time learning it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the global pandemic starts, my older brother bought a laptop. Then that was the golden era of learning programming for me. I started making mobile applications using Java on Android studio and an idea pops on my brain, I found out that Filipinos these days needs another source of income. So I decided to make a mobile application called CaptCash where you can earn money by answering captchas. I had a hard time doing it, after months developing the product, I stopped. Long story short, I am continuing it now but the idea of the product is completely different, but Filipinos can still earn using the product.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created this personal website when I was freelancing, I post my projects here and the Programming Philippines Facebook Group. Until someone from <a href="https://unirises.com">Unirises</a> asked me to join their great company and I agreed. I don't do freelancing now. I also decided to continue what I have done then which is starting my own company called Koowentu Technology.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Tech Stuff:</strong>
                    <br>
                    I know Python, Java, Javascript, and Dart(Flutter) programming languages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the website development, I know backend web frameworks like Django and Flask, in the frontend I know Vue and React.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the Mobile App development, I know Java using Android Studio. In cross-platform development, I know Flutter and a little bit of React Native.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love Python, actually I created projects using Python3 like <a href="https://github.com/jabezborja/jarvan-ai">Jarvan AI (Virtual Assistant)</a> a with Pyttsx3 and SpeechRecognition (Python modules), a Programming Language called <a href="https://github.com/jabezborja/tagalag">TagaLag</a>, it has a tagalog syntax and it's not finished yet.

                    <strong>About this website:</strong>
                    <br>
                    This website was PURELY created with Python Django Web Framework as Backend. HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework, JavaScript as Frontend, PostgreSQL for Database (For saving Projects and other website Datas), and Heroku for Deployment.
                    But because of Heroku always sleeping after minutes of visiting my website, this website cannot do SEO stuff. I decided to make this website static and use static hosting for free.
